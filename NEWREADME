# Dan-Ger Zone

Dan-Ger Zone is a semester project prototype for **ISYS 43603 – Business Project Development**.

This repository now includes an initial working front-end MVP for a web-based calendar and messaging application aligned to the project vision.

## Current Prototype Features

- Mock secure login screen (session-local auth)
- Appointment management (create, edit, delete)
- Client linkage for each appointment
- Message template generation for Sales and HR workflows
- Message history tracking
- Dashboard summary with upcoming appointments and recent messages
- Appointment reminder banner for near-term meetings
- Search/filter support for appointments and messages
- Message categorization for HR/Sales workflows

## Quick Start

Because this is a static app, you can run it with any local web server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

- `http://localhost:8000/app/`
